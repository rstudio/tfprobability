Description: Interface to 'TensorFlow Probability', a 'Python' library built on 'TensorFlow'
    that makes it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning on modern hardware ('TPU', 'GPU').
    'TensorFlow Probability' includes a wide selection of probability distributions and bijectors, probabilistic layers,
    variational inference, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and optimizers such as Nelder-Mead, BFGS, and SGLD.
